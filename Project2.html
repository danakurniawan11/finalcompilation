  <h1>Project 2: Web/Visual Translation</h1>
  <p>The images below show the object I chose to translate from the RISD museum.</p><br>

  <img src="chairPR2.png" alt="RISDChair">

  <h3>What strikes you about the work?</h3>
  <p>The way light interacts with the materiality of the metallic surface lends a sense of depth and dimension that makes the hard surface look so beautifully woven together.</p>

  <h3>Understanding visual characteristics</h3>

  <p>I was most drawn to the color and texture of this object, namely its hues under different angles of light. The chromatic bronze appears both gleaming and rusted, matte but shiny. In my sketches, I attempted to break down some of its basic shapes and isolate them. Ultimately, the elegance comes from these basic shapes and the different hues inspired by web translation.</p>

  <img style="padding-top: 50px;" src="sketch.png" alt="sketches">

  <h3>Web characteristics</h3>
  <p>I attempted to portray the depth and dimension of the chair on the web, using the web as a dynamic canvas to challenge 2-D constructions.</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Use animation to change hues based on the colors at different angles</li>

  <li>Sense of depth and rigidity, but also malleability in casting the original metal (word animation).</li>

  <li>Two modes -- one in which we see the original image and have the ability to ‘magnify ’with the cursor to isolate the hues. The other mode, where the user has the option to ‘drag’ the shapes against the color animation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Design Brief</h3>
  <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">I want to translate a sense of dimension, rigidity, but also malleability to portray the metallic surface and metal’s behavior. </p>
